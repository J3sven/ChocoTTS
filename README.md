ChocoTTS is a WebSocket-based interpreter for the [TextToTalk](https://github.com/karashiiro/TextToTalk) plugin in Dalamud, enabling lifelike text-to-speech (TTS) and emotion inference from text. It uses the üê∏[Coqui Ai TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) model for generating speech and [j-hartmann's emotion transformer model](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base) for detecting emotions in text.
